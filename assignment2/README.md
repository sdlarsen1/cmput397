# Assignment 2 README:

TODO:
 * Add compilation and execution instructions,
 * Disclose all collaborations and websites/resources you've consulted
 * Add test cases for bonus marks

### create_lms.py instructions
- to run the program, enter: `python3 create_lms.py [dir/to/test/] [output/dir/]`
    - the program will create `a2.db` in the specified output directory

### nb_classifier.py instructions
- to run the program, enter: `python3 nb_classifier.py [path/to/train/data] [path/to/test/data]`
	- for example, enter: `python3 nb_classifier.py trec-397/data/train/ trec-397/data/test/`
	- give this file approx. a minute to run.
